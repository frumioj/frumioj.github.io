It was my first fulltime job after graduating from university. I'd been hired by a prominent building society
(mortgage bank). We were an IBM shop, and I'd been lucky enough to work with IBM's innovative OS/2 operating
system, but Bob, the company CTO was very much a fan of Windows (3?). In the meantime though, we had 550 branch
offices all running [IBM 3270 financial controller terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270) connected
via coax, to our mighty old mainframe. 

The big plan of the day was to replace that little lot with PCs running Windows, and a local area (token ring) network in each office. 

The first part (PCs) had been done, but so far, they were just running a DOS 3270 terminal emulator, and showing the dull old CICS mainframe mortgage "app".

Bob was excited to install Windows everywhere - his pet project. But the executives knew it would be some time before this was financially possible. 

So they asked Bob if it were possible to get some of the features available in Windows...
