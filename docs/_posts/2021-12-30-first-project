It was my first fulltime job after graduating from university. I'd been hired by a prominent building society
(mortgage bank). We were an IBM shop, and I'd been lucky enough to work with IBM's innovative OS/2 operating
system, but Bob, the company CTO was very much a fan of Windows (3?). In the meantime though, we had 550 branch
offices all running [IBM 3270 financial controller terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270) connected
via coax, to our mighty old mainframe. 

The big plan of the day was to replace that little lot with PCs running Windows, and a local area (token ring) network in each office.
